Testing in Spring boot with Scala tests

Spring boot tests provides great support for testing which combined with the sugar syntax form scala tests makes testing more pleasant and less verbose.

Please find all the code used in this post in github (https://github.com/ignacioSuay/spring-scala-tests)

## Dependencies

We will need to add the following dependencies to our project:Spring boot, Scala and ScalaTests,

As the ScalaTest documentation(http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_the_scalatest_maven_plugin) recommends we should disable the surefire plugin.

I am building this project with Maven so the pom.xml file looks like:

[add pom.xml]

## Sample Controller and service

In order to have a controller to test, I need to create a simple Customer Rest controller which which given a customer id calls findCustomer in the CustomerService.

Here is the CustomerController:

[add code]

And the CustomerService:

[add code]

## Unit testing the controller with @WebMvcTest

The first that we want to test is the Controller in isolation.

As you can see in the CustomerController, this class has a dependency to the CustomerService.
For the unit test we are going to mock the CustomerService using the @MockBean annotation provided by Spring.

Spring provides the @WebMvcTest annotation which is very useful when you are only interested in instantiating the web layer and not the whole Spring context.
This annotation will only load configuration relevant to MVC tests (@Controller, @RestController., @ControllerAdvice...) but will disable full auto-configuration (@Component, @Service or @Repository won't be instantiated).

Here are the steps that I followed:

1. Annotate the class with: @RunWith(classOf[SpringRunner]) and @WebMvcTest(Array(classOf[CustomerControler]))

2. Autowired MockMvc. Note that @WebMvcTest auto-configures MockMvc without needing to start a web container.

3. A

By default, @WebMvcTest loads all the controllers but in this case I am just interested in loading 1 controller (CustomerControler), so I add  the name of the controller to the annotation.

Due to the fact that @WebMvcTest doesn't load any @Service configuration, we need to mock the CustomerService by using the @MockBean annotation.


TestContextManager is the main entry point into the Spring TestContext Framework, which provides support for loading and accessing application contexts, dependency injection of test instances, transactional execution of test methods, etc.
